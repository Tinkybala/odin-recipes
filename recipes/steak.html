    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thickish cut steak – no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on the stove (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). Ideal steaks: boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, porterhouse / New York, T-bone. Grade: takes high quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh Thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;</li>
        <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;</li>
        <li>Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</li>
        <li>WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li>
        <li>Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and</li>
        <li>REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
    </ol>
